IMPORTANT FOR ABDO

Before implementing updated files to the production:

1. Run the code from "sql-update" file.
2. Unzip "ratchat.zip". The folder "ratchat" should be in the same directory as "dashboard.php".
3. Uncomment php code in the beginning of "dashboard.php".
4. Replace the database connection settings in the beginning of "ratchat.php".
5. There's a possibility to replace 'testuser' with your current username, look at the js function StartChat() in the "dashboard.php".

Then just delete this file :)
